<h1>AEMR Case Study</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>
The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the stability, reliability, and continuity of the domestic energy network in the United States, aiming to minimize disruptions and outages. However, the AEMR currently penalizes only forced outages among the four types (consequential, opportunistic, forced, planned) due to their potential to exceed energy supply, impacting network reliability and stability.


<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
What strategies can be implemented to decrease energy loss by approximately 5% and reduce outage events by around 17% at AEMR, thereby enhancing energy stability and market reliability for the 2016/2017 period?



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>AEMR documented a total of 4,655 outages in the year 2016 to 2017, out of which 4,102 were approved outages, resulting in an overall energy loss of 156,211 MW, with 124,448 MW attributed to approved outages.</b>
- <b>During this period, there was a notable increase in energy loss by approximately 5% and a rise in outage events by around 17%. However, approved outages saw a significant increase of 12%. </b>
- <b>Forced outages accounted for the majority, constituting 70% of all outage types, with a substantial increase of 28% from 2016 to 2017. Conversely, Opportunistic Maintenance recorded the lowest number of 
     outage events.</b>
- <b>Upon further analysis of outage durations, Scheduled outages were found to have the longest duration, lasting approximately 5 days. While Forced outages had a shorter duration of 0.6 days, their unplanned 
     nature and frequency pose significant risks to network performance and reliability, leading to increased energy loss.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Additionally, an analysis of complaints descriptions associated with the recorded outages identified the top three issues and their corresponding facilities:

<b>Operational issues causing real-time forced outage (BW1_GREENWATER facility)<b>
<b>FO (PJRH_GT11 facility)<b>
<b>TES Report_constrained off MW's (PEATHENENERGY_KOR facility)
Deviation from dispatch (TIWEST_COG1 facility)."<b>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Cancellation Management Strategies: Implement measures to mitigate cancellations, particularly for City hotels, such as introducing flexible cancellation policies or requiring deposits for bookings to 
     ensure commitment from guests.</b>
- <b>Seasonal Pricing Strategy: Capitalize on peak booking periods in August, July, and May by implementing dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue during high-demand seasons.</b>
- <b>Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Leverage demographic preferences to tailor marketing efforts towards European countries, focusing on promotions and offers that appeal to guests from Portugal, Great Britain, 
     France, Spain, and Germany.</b>
- <b>Enhanced Online Presence: Strengthen partnerships with Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) to further penetrate the online booking market segment, optimizing visibility and accessibility for potential guests.</b>
- <b>Customer Loyalty Programs: Develop initiatives to increase customer retention, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers for repeated guests, to foster long-term relationships and encourage repeat 
     bookings.</b>
- <b>Review Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and pricing structure to ensure competitiveness within the market while maintaining profitability, considering factors such as demand trends 
     and guest preferences.</b>
- <b>Optimization of Room Allocation: Allocate resources and prioritize inventory management strategies to accommodate fluctuations in demand during peak booking periods, ensuring efficient utilization of hotel 
     facilities and maximizing revenue potential.<b>
